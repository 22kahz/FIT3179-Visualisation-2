            Small, wealthy countries like Qatar have the highest per capita
            emissions whereas large countries such as China are the top
            contributors to total emissions but their per capita emissions vary.

            Sector Emissions of the Top 10 Emitting Countries
          </h2>
          <p class="text">
            The top 10 per capita emitters are mostly small, wealthy countries
            or developed countries.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            The electricity and heat sector is typically the largest contributor
            to per capita CO₂ emissions, followed by transport and industry.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            Australia, the US, and Canada also have high per capita emissions,
            with significant contributions from transport and industry, due to
            large land areas, high car ownership, and resource-based industries.
            In some cases, Land-use change and forestry emissions are negative,
            showing the benefits of reforestation.
